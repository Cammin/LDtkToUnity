### Disclaimer
This project has stabilized development! :tada:  
There may still be some new features, but development is calming down.  
The changelog documents any breaking changes, but feel free to post issues regarding any problems.

###### Premise & Review
This importer started as an attempt to produce levels in an easy and streamlined fashion.
When searching for a solution to mass-produce levels, I discovered LDtk, as its really fun to use and is relatively young. 
I started working on a personal level importer, but after noticing how convenient and standalone the importer has become, I took it upon myself to make this a public repo as a package!
I enjoy it's production, and learning a lot in the process.
