# IntGrids Section

Assign [**IntGrid Tiles**](../Topics/topic_IntGridTile.md) for collision.  

Create a new Int Grid Tile with the button at the top-right region of the inspector.

- All of the IntGrid layers and their values are displayed here for assigning.
  - The IntGrid Tiles are primarily used for collision, however there are also options for simple rendering, or GameObjects in tile-space.

- Choose whether to render IntGrid Tiles in the [**Main Section**](topic_Section_Main.md).
- The fields also accept TileBase, so any kind of custom tile is allowed. However if you use IntGrid tiles, there's options for separating Tag/Layer/PhysicsMaterial.
