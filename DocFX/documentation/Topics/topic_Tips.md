# Tips
Some Tips & Tricks and best practice encouragement.

- It's best to make entity prefabs be simple prefabs in order to avoid lots of time-consuming reimporting
- Double clicking the LDtk file in the project window will conveniently open the project in LDtk.

- Most (if not all) fields have tooltips to help explain itself.
- Most (if not all) MonoBehaviours and ScriptableObjects have help references available to quickly refer back to topics in this documentation.

- Renaming LDtk assets inside of Unity is blocked. You should only be allowed to rename projects from inside LDtk. LDtk will automatically also rename the meta file!
